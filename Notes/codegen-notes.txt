All of the code gen part of the compiler should be working. We added tests and tried to automate them by
writing a script.

We ended up using some assembly language that was outside the scope of what was discussed in lecture.

We tried to be clever with boolean expressions by setting only one bit of %rax to 1 or 0 depending on
if something was true or false while setting all the other bits to 0.

We did have to go back and fix some of the semantics checking issues that we were docked down on. If we didn't fix them,
we would have had some issues with inheritance.
