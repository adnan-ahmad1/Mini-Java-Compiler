All of the code gen part of the compiler should be working.

We ended up using some assembly language that was outside the scope of what was discussed in lecture.

We had some issues with control flow because we were unsure how to do them, so we tried to be clever
with boolean expressions by setting only one bit of %rax to 1 or 0 depending on
if something was true or false while setting all the other bits to 0.

We did have to go back and fix some of the semantics checking issues that we were docked down on. If we didn't fix them,
we would have had some issues with inheritance. We wrote some tests to make sure everything that was mentioned passes.

We wrote a ton of tests in SamplePrograms/CodeGenTests. We also have a ton of
.expected files in test/resources. We also wrote two scripts to automate the tests
for both semantics and code gen. We had to research some bash stuff. If we somehow miss a staff test, we will
be pretty depressed given we wrote so many tests this time for code gen :(

We weren't sure what to do for array out of bounds until the last day. I think we didn't read the spec properly
but we ended up fixing the issue.

Thanks :)
