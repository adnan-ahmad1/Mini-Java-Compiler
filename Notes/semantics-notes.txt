We didn't really change anything from the previous parts of the project except for the AST nodes. We added a type
for the expression nodes and also moved identifier from classDeclSimple and classDeclExtends to classDecl.

Our first pass fills global and local symbol tables. We also check super classes, any inheritance cycles, and then override
issues in the first pass. In out second pass, we type check everything.

When there is an inheritance cycle, we print out the symbol table and exit with 1. We skip type checking because
of potential infinite recursion issues;

We also made a bunch of tests in a folder called SemanticsTests in SamplePrograms. It was hard to compare outputs, so we
just checked everything over.
